Waken up by the moonlight, you find yourself in the soft grass, wide as your field of view.
Your blue eyes point towards the sky, watching the flying angels fly around.
After that, you stand up, noticing that you are surrounded of dark green trees.
There are two paths. One towards the moon, the other towards a tall mountain.

You go towards the mountain, around the soft trees and flashing fireflies.
The top of the mountain is full of snow, soft as a polar bear. Also, you see a cave, black as a black hole.

You go towards the snow through a clean path. Then you play through the snow.
Then you see a small house with smoke going out of his chimney. You also want to go back to the cave to see what it is about.
You enter to the small house and you see a couch. You see also a little kitchen.
You fall asleep on the couch and hours later, see the warm sunbeam through your window.

You go to the cave. Then you see a flashlight on the floor.

You grab it up and you turn it on. It still has some charge for a few hours.
You go deeper through the cave, feeling the coldness surround your body. Lucky enough, you find a leather jacket.

You wear it and go deeper. Then you find someone, thinking "I know who this is."
You grab him up and go back to the moonlight. He's still breathing, but he's uncouscious.

You decide to go with him through the snow.
You find a little house in the middle of the snow. You go and open the door.
You put him to rest on a couch inside the house. In the house there's a kitchen. Maybe you could make a tea for him... if you find tea, obviously.
You find a tea box inside a little door. You put water to boil and grab a mug.
You put the tea mug next to him and rest on another couch.

You decide to leave him outside the cave and investigate why is he uncounscious.
You hope that the flashlight can hold some minutes turned on.
Hearing the silent waterdrops hit the cold floor, being afraid of dying alone, you go deeper into the cave.
Someone is smelling your bloody meat...
GAME OVER.

You decide to leave it where it is. Later, you freeze and die from hypothermia.
GAME OVER.

You decide to not take the flashlight with you. Minutes later, you fall into ice cold water and drown.
GAME OVER.

You go towards the moon and find a beach. You walk through the soft sand, touching it with your fingers.
Then you go deeper on the ocean, seeing the fish swim through the water.
You find a body near the water. You know who this is.
You get her out of the water. She's still alive.

You decide to go with her to the mountain, around the soft trees and flashing fireflies.
The top of the mountain is full of snow, soft as a polar bear. Also, you see a cave, black as a black hole.

You decide to go with her through the snow.

You decide to go with both of them through the snow.

You put they to rest on couches inside the house. In the house there's a kitchen. Maybe you could make tea for them... if you find tea, obviously.
